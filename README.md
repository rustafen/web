Produce more and write less. Rustagen Web Framework brings features that are easy to understand and maintain over the long term.
Our package supports an easy-to-apply syntax for your web projects with pure CSS or predefined Classes. You can use other frameworks without having any problems with identical classes or IDs.

ATTENTION
We are starting the project so there may be many resources missing that will be implemented soon.
